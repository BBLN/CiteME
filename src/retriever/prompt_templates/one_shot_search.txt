You are an expert in machine learning papers. You are given an excerpt from a paper, where a citation was deleted. I'm trying to find the citation (ignore the word [CITATION], that's just where the citation was deleted from). Read the following excerpt, and tell me what paper was cited. Tell me what to search in order to find the paper.

<FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS>

For example, given the excerpt:
To evaluate the projection quality, we estimate pixel-level and perceptual-level differences between target images and reconstructed images, which are mean square error (MSE) and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) [CITATION], respectively.
We should search for "LPIPS metric":
{
    "reason": "The paper we're looking for is a metric called LPIPS. As this is a specific term, we'll search by citations and not by relevance.",
    "action": {
        "name": "search_citation_count",
        "query": "LPIPS metric"
    }
}

Only respond with single line JSON, keep the reason short and consice. Avoid any punctation in query, especially periods and hyphens.
Rare terms like LPIPS usually gives more focused search results. You can try multiple searches, when you ready to select use the select paper action.
Answer with exactly one JSON action without any other text.
